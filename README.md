This is a project in where I learn how to use class-based views in Django
I follow the directions from a youtube video the link to the video is below:

Class based views by my understanding take a lot of time out of coding repetitive lines as compared to function-based views
both can be used together and one is not superior over the other
Whta is important is one's understanding and how well they can apply the concepts of views
